# Journey-to-the-Thingamajig
My first published flash game. 

You can play it here:

This was my first personal project. I started it in the summer of 2013 and had 
worked on it on and off until 2016 when I finally published it on gamejolt and kongregate.

Of course, I learned a lot along the way and I readily admit there are a lot of improvements that could be made.
The only experience I had with programming when I began this was my introductory computer science course. I am open to
suggestions for improvements in the code.

I used both windows and mac to create this (most recently, mac). I used the flex compiler shell (fsch) in mac to compile it, Sublime to write/edit code, Deadly Alien Map Editor (DAME) to create the levels,
and piskel.com to create/edit sprites.

Feel free to modify the code as you wish.
